      cd backend
      ```
    - Install dependencies:
      ```bash
      npm install
      ```
    - Create a `.env` file for environment variables:
      ```
      MONGO_URI=your_mongodb_connection_string
      JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret_key
      EMAILJS_USER_ID=your_emailjs_user_id

          name: name,
          email: email,
          days: days,

          templateParams, 
          'EpeB5yDPAKKpw8v7o'
        )
          .then((response) => {
            console.log('Email successfully sent!', response.status, response.text);
          })
          .catch((err) => {

5. **Access the application:**
    - Open your browser and go to `http://localhost:3000` for the frontend.
    - The backend will be running on `http://localhost:3002` by default.

## Email Notifications

When a customer books a room, the application sends an email notification to both the customer and the house owner using EmailJS. To set this up:

1. **EmailJS Configuration:**
   - Sign up at [EmailJS](https://www.emailjs.com/) and create a new email service and template.
   - Obtain your `user_id`, `service_id`, and `template_id` from the EmailJS dashboard.

3. **Integrate EmailJS:**
   - Configure the EmailJS setup in your frontend as outlined in the [Installation](#installation) section.
   - Use the `sendBookingEmail` function from `emailService.js` to send booking notifications upon successful room booking.

## MongoDB Integration

To use MongoDB for storing data, including user information, room details, and booking records, follow these steps:

1. **Set Up MongoDB:**
   - Sign up for a MongoDB Atlas account or set up a local MongoDB instance.
   - Create a new database for the application.
  
     ```javascript
     const handleLogin=(e)=>{
     e.preventDefault()
     axios.post('http://localhost:3000/login',{loginemail,loginpassword})
     .then(result=>{
      setShowSignUp(true);
      Nav('/')
     })
     .catch(err=>{
      console.log(err);
     })
     }
     const handleSignin=(e)=>{
     e.preventDefault();
     axios.post('http://localhost:3000/register',{
      signname,signusername,signuseremail,signuserPassword
     })
     .then(result=>{
      setActiveTab('login')
     })
     .catch(err=>{
      console.log('error')
     })
     }
  ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e2cbe1c3-25c3-4bb9-a5bb-2076e5b72242)

2. **Create Collections:**
   - `users` for authentication and user management.
   - `rooms` for storing room listings.
   - `bookings` for tracking customer bookings.
```javascript
  const handleSubmit = (e) => {
    e.preventDefault();
    // Here you can handle the form submission, e.g., sending the data to a server
    const formData=new FormData();
    formData.append('name',name)
    formData.append('price',price)
    formData.append('description',description)
    formData.append('file',image)
    axios.post('http://localhost:3001/registerhome',formData,{
      headers:{
        "Content-Type":'multipart/form-data'
      }
    })
    .then(result=>{
      console.log("ok")
      Nav('/rooms')
    })
    .catch(err=>{
      console.error(err);
    })
  };
```

3. **Backend Configuration:**
   - Install Mongoose:

     ```bash
     npm install mongoose
     ```

   - Configure MongoDB connection in your `backend/index.js`:

     ```javascript
     const mongoose = require('mongoose');
     require('dotenv').config();

     const mongoURI = process.env.MONGO_URI;

     mongoose.connect(mongoURI, {
       useNewUrlParser: true,
       useUnifiedTopology: true
     }).then(() => {
       console.log('MongoDB connected');
     }).catch(err => {
       console.error('MongoDB connection error:', err);
     });
     ```

   - Define Mongoose models for `User`, `Room`, and `Booking` in the `models` directory.
